D. arcturi of the Dosera family, commonly known as sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to New Zealand. This is one of two native drosera species in New Zealand. This plant is a sub-alpine or alpine herb. On the North Island the herb can be found above 1500m while in the South Island it descends to sea level. Generally, they are found in wet alpine bogs, tarns, and seepages. The herb can also be found in the mountains of Australia and Tasmania.

The plant has linear leaves that rang form 1-20cm but generally remains less than 5cm. The leaves are undivided and have a wide range of colors but when in full sun turn a bright red. As the leaves begin to grow they remain folded along the center of the plant until they reach maturity and unfold. On the leaves, sundews have sticky, glandular hairs that are used to capture their prey. These hairs tend to be red and trap small bugs that can then be digested by the plant, similar to a Venus flytrap. The prey can be trapped by coming in contact with the hairs and becoming stuck due to the sticky nature.

The sundews are carnivorous in order to fulfill nutrient needs not met by the alpine soil that they live in. There few to zero nitrogen fixing plants in the alpine area where the sundew are, creating a nitrogen deficiency in the soil. To combat this deficiency the plants trap insects, which act as a source of nitrogen for the sundew.

Being angiosperms, sundews flower. They flower in the spring, from November to April, after they have grown a few upright leaves. The flowers are single and white, usually measuring around 13mm in diameter. Flowering continued from November to February and fruiting spans from January to March. As growing begins, the flowers elongate creating horn shaped hibernaculum. The hibernaculum become buried under soil or moss during the winter as protection against the snow.
